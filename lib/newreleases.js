 * newreleases.js — what came out recently by the acts you actually listen to.
 *
 * The Discover screen's one real engine. Pure: every function takes plain data
 * and returns a decision. The fetching, the cache and the daily schedule live
 * in index.js, next to Smart Picks' equivalents.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEEDED FROM PLAYS AND NOT FROM THE LIBRARY. They are different
 * questions and only one of them is this feature's. The library is what you
 * OWN — it includes the record a friend recommended once, the box set bought
 * for one disc, and everything imported in bulk years ago. Seeding from it
 * makes "new from artists you play" a promise the data cannot keep. The plays
 * table is what you came BACK to, which is the whole claim in the row's title.
 *
 * AND THE TRACK ARTIST IS THE RIGHT ARTIST HERE, which is the opposite of the
 * call the Home history row makes. That row deliberately takes the artist from
 * the snapshot, because `plays.artist` is the TRACK artist and a compilation
 * would name a performer rather than the record. Here the performer is exactly
 * what is wanted: if you play one track off a compilation forty times, that
 * act is one you listen to, and the compilation's "Various Artists" is not.
 *
 * DEEZER, FOR THE SAME REASON lib/similar.js GIVES. There is no keyless
 * new-release feed keyed on an artist anywhere else: MusicBrainz can browse
 * release-groups by artist but rate-limits to one request a second and carries
 * no artwork, and the streaming services' own "new releases" are editorial
 * charts rather than anything to do with who you play. Deezer answers
 * `/artist/<id>/albums` with dates, cover art and a record type, and this
 * codebase already reads that exact endpoint for the share card's suggestions.
 *
 * THE ONE THING DEEZER CANNOT TELL US is whether a 2026 date is a new record
 * or a reissue of an old one: the listing carries the date of THAT EDITION and
 * there is no original-release field. A remaster presented as new is the
 * failure mode this module is mostly built to avoid — see isReissue.

 * after singles and EPs were reported on a screen that filters for
 * record_type === "album". Whether that is because Deezer files some singles
 * as albums or because something else is going on, a five-track floor cannot
 * be the wrong side of the EP/album line often enough to matter — and when it
 * is, it hides a row rather than showing the wrong kind of one, which is the
