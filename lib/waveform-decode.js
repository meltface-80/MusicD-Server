/*
 * waveform-decode.js — get PCM out of an audio file and peaks out of the PCM.
 *
 * ffmpeg is the decoder because the library is mixed: FLAC, ALAC in m4a, AAC,
 * MP3, WAV, AIFF. A per-format JS decoder would be a stack of dependencies that
 * still misses one.
 *
 * LOCAL FILES ONLY, and there is no other case. This server plays the user's
 * own files to Sonos and has no streaming account to hold a URL for, so the
 * pipe-from-HTTPS path MusicD Remote needs for Qobuz and TIDAL is deliberately
 * not carried over — an unused branch that spawns a subprocess is a liability
 * rather than a spare part.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASKED OF ffmpeg, and why each flag:
 *
 *   -v error         nothing on stderr but real failures, so the buffer below
 *                    stays small and a non-zero exit has a usable message
 *   -nostdin         never wait on a terminal that is not there
 *   -i <file>
 *   -map 0:a:0       the FIRST audio stream only. Some rips carry a second
 *                    (commentary, a different mix); without this ffmpeg picks
 *                    by its own rules and the waveform could be of the wrong one
 *   -f s16le         raw samples, no container to parse on this side
 *   -ac 1            downmix to mono: a stereo waveform drawn in one bar is
 *                    the max of the two channels anyway
 *   -ar 16000        see DECODE_RATE below
 *
 * The spawn is injected so the whole path can be tested without ffmpeg on the
 * machine, and so a test can make it fail, hang, or dribble bytes.

/*
 * The rate the audio is decoded to before peaks are taken.
 *
 * 16 kHz, and the reason is amplitude rather than time. Resampling to 8 kHz
 * makes ffmpeg lowpass at 4 kHz FIRST, so every cymbal, snare crack and
 * sibilant — most of whose energy sits above that — is filtered away before it
 * can register as a peak. MusicD Remote measured that as a systematic
 * flattening, not noise, and the decode of the compressed source dominates the
 * wall clock anyway, so the extra PCM is close to free.
 *
 * CHANGING THIS INVALIDATES EVERY STORED WAVEFORM. Rows analysed at a different
 * rate have genuinely different shapes, and a library holding both would draw
 * two kinds of picture with no way to tell which is which — which is why the
 * rate is stored beside the peaks and a change re-analyses.
