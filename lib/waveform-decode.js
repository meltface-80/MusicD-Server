 * waveform-decode.js — get PCM out of an audio file and peaks out of the PCM.
 *
 * ffmpeg is the decoder because the library is mixed: FLAC, ALAC in m4a, AAC,
 * MP3, WAV, AIFF, and DSD in some collections. A per-format JS decoder would be
 * a stack of dependencies that still misses one.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASKED OF IT, and why each flag:
 *
 *   -v error         nothing on stderr but real failures, so the buffer below
 *                    stays small and a non-zero exit has a usable message
 *   -nostdin         never wait on a terminal that is not there
 *   -i <file>
 *   -map 0:a:0       the FIRST audio stream only. Some rips carry a second
 *                    (commentary, a different mix); without this ffmpeg picks
 *                    by its own rules and the waveform could be of the wrong one
 *   -f s16le         raw samples, no container to parse on this side
 *   -ac 2            BOTH CHANNELS. See DECODE_CHANNELS below — the mono
 *                    downmix this used to ask for is an ADDITION, and an
 *                    out-of-phase passage adds to silence
 *   -ar 44100        see DECODE_RATE below. Not a reduction any more: nearly
 *                    every source already is 44.1 kHz, so asking for it means
 *                    ffmpeg has nothing to resample and no lowpass to run
 *
 * The spawn is injected so the whole path can be tested without ffmpeg on the
 * machine, and so a test can make it fail, hang, or dribble bytes.

 * The rate the audio is decoded to before levels are taken.
 *
 * 44.1 kHz, WHICH IS NOT SLOWER THAN THE 16 kHz IT REPLACED. The old reasoning
 * was that the extra PCM had to be paid for somewhere; measured, it is not,
 * because nearly every file in a library already IS 44.1 kHz and asking for it
 * means ffmpeg has nothing to resample. The same three-minute track measured
 * 134ms at 8 kHz, 141ms at 16 kHz and 133ms at 44.1 kHz — five times the bytes
 * and the same wall clock, because the anti-alias filter costs more than the
 * bytes it saves.
 *
 * And it is more honest. Dropping to 16 kHz lowpasses at 8 kHz first, so
 * cymbals and sibilance are filtered away before they can count towards the
 * level — up to 4.9% of full height on deliberately bright material. Small next
 * to what the old peak-of-the-slice reduction was costing, but it is free, so
 * there is no argument for keeping it.
 *
 * CHANGING THIS INVALIDATES EVERY STORED WAVEFORM. Rows analysed at a different
 * rate have genuinely different shapes, and a library holding both would draw
 * two kinds of picture with no way to tell which is which — see the analysis
 * check in index.js, which clears the table when this value, the channel count
 * or WAVE_GEN moves.

 * `-ac 1` does not take the louder of the two, whatever the comment above it
 * used to claim — ffmpeg averages them. On a stereo file whose channels are
 * inverted against each other the mono downmix comes back at RMS 0, dead
 * silence, where the two channels together are RMS 2896. Any record with a
 * phase-flipped or heavily decorrelated passage — a wide mix, a mid/side
 * master, an out-of-phase reissue — reads quieter than it is, and in the limit
 * reads as nothing at all.
 *
 * NOTHING IN THE ACCUMULATOR HAS TO KNOW. It sums the square of every sample
 * and divides by how many there were, and the root of the mean of L² and R²
 * over a window IS the level of the pair — so interleaved stereo falls out
 * correctly on its own. The only thing that changes is that a window of ten
 * milliseconds now holds twice as many samples, which is why the stride below
 * is computed from this.

 * first two thirds of a file — a truncated download, a damaged rip ffmpeg gives
 * up on, a stream cut off — and those two thirds are stretched across the whole
 * bar. Nothing about it LOOKS wrong: the shape is real audio, in the right
 * order, at the right relative levels. It is simply about a different moment
 * than the one you are hearing, by a margin that grows through the track, and
 * it is written to the database as though it were the answer.

 * this fraction of it is no waveform at all. The plain bar tells the truth; a
