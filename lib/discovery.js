 * Discovery data sources for Smart Picks — artist similarity and genre rosters.

 *
 * Three keyless, public reads. None of them touches the Roon Core: Smart Picks
 * costs the Core exactly nothing beyond the sync it already runs.
 *
 *   1. ListenBrainz Labs similar-artists (CC0). The primary graph. Takes
 *      MusicBrainz artist MBIDs and returns similar artists WITH their own
 *      MBIDs and a score, so candidates carry a stable identity and never have
 *      to be re-matched by name.
 *   2. ListenBrainz sitewide top artists. The hub list — see topArtists.
 *   3. MusicBrainz artist search by tag. The roster for the stretch pick —
 *      it returns a genre's canonical names first (flamenco => Camarón de la
 *      Isla, Paco de Lucía), which is what keeps the daily stretch defensible
 *      rather than a random unknown.
 *
 * A NOTE ON SEED CHOICE, because it decides whether this feature is any good:
 * similarity quality INVERTS with seed popularity. Seeding from a library's
 * biggest names returns the airport bookshop of music (Radiohead => Nirvana,
 * RHCP, Coldplay). Seeding from its obscure end returns real discoveries
 * (Bark Psychosis => Mogwai, Talk Talk, Tortoise, Slint, Labradford). The
 * seed policy lives in index.js; this module just has to not get in its way,
 * which is why nothing here re-sorts by score.
