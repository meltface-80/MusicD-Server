/*
 * waveform.js — turning decoded audio into the handful of numbers a progress
 * bar can draw. No I/O and no ffmpeg, so all of it is testable in node.
 *
 * Ported from MusicD Remote, which worked this out first; the streaming half of
 * it is deliberately absent here, because this server only ever has local
 * files and there is no second case to carry.
 *
 * The shape of the problem:
 *
 *   ffmpeg hands us signed 16-bit mono PCM on a pipe, in chunks of whatever
 *   size the OS feels like. We do not know the track's length up front (a
 *   container's header can lie, and ffmpeg will happily decode past it), and we
 *   want a fixed number of buckets at the end regardless.
 *
 *   So this accumulates at a FIXED STRIDE while the audio streams — one peak
 *   per `stride` samples, which for the 16 kHz decode is ~62 values a second —
 *   and resamples that down to the final bucket count once the length is known.
 *   A five-minute track holds ~18,750 intermediate values, so the memory cost is
 *   a rounding error and nothing has to be buffered whole.
 *
 * Why peak and not RMS: a progress bar wants the track's SHAPE — where the
 * quiet intro ends, where the loud middle is. RMS flattens exactly that.
